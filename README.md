**Programming assignment submission for Week 3 of module "Getting and Cleaning data"**

The script run_analysis.R  performs the following actions:

  1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  
  2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  
  3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  
  4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  
  5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity     and each subject.

The file CodeBook.md in this repository describes the steps performed to get the tidy data set.

The file Tidy.txt is the output of the execution of script run_analysis.R
